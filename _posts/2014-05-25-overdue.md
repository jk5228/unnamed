The camera equipment I borrowed is now one day overdue. I walked all the way to the library and learned that it closed early when my eyes landed on the dreaded 'The library is closed' sign. Since I had all this equipment on me and I'd be paying for it tomorrow, I thought I'd make the most of it. I'm glad I did!
