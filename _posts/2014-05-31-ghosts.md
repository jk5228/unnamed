After sunset, the campus has renewed vibrance. As I headed toward the Yale Rep to snap the first photos of the night, alumni strolled to the next reunion venue, probably to carry on with their carousing. They didn't strike me as nostalgic. They were ecstatic, as if still college students now in the guise of forty, fifty, sixty year olds. Like ghosts streaming by, untouchable, inexorable.

This was my first attempt at long-exposure photography. I think things turned out pretty well! I also experimented with blur and "light painting." Many comical 20-30 second long exposures later, I got eerie, ghost-like portraits populated with yours truly. With more experience, I'd like to try producing something like [Project 12:31](http://project1231.com/).
