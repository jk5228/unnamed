After sunset, the campus has renewed vibrance. As I headed toward the Yale Rep to snap the first photos of the night, alumni strolled to the next reunion venue, probably to carry on with their carousing. They didn't strike me as nostalgic. They were ecstatic, as if still college students but in the guise of forty, fifty, sixty year olds. Like ghosts streaming by, untouchable, inexorable.
