We wilt in the Cambridge sun,  
Sitting on a waist-high wall,  
Incoherent even to ourselves.  

We leap from handrail to wall,  
Feeling the red slag surge,  
Holding our breath,  
Puffing our cheeks,  
Just for a second.  

The bells of this old town  
Ring through clamoring streets,  
Filled with fussy tourists,  
Carrying their plastic bags,  
Puffed up with air.  

Books neglected,  
Departing buses neglected,  
University neglected,  
I leap to a handrail  
And slip.  

I watch the tourists watch,  
Heads shaking, eyes filled  
With scornful pity,  
Mouths whispering,  
_Going nowhere_.  

We all wilt.  

We wilt in the Cambridge sun,  
Running, leaping, falling,  
Holding our breath,  
Falling, flying,  
If only for a second,  
Going nowhere.
